## Challenges

Challenge yourself with coding challenges that will test your algorithmic problem-solving skills. These challenges are a great way to improve your Python proficiency.

### [Challenge 1: HH:MM:SS](/challenges/challenge1)

Converts a given second input into HH:MM:SS format.

### [Challenge 3: Primes](/challenges/challenge2)

Finding the next prime in a given array.

### [Challenge 4: Distance](/challenges/challenge3)

This Python code defines a class called Point to represent 2D points with a description, and provides functions to calculate the minimum and maximum distances between a collection of these points. It reads a collection of points from a binary file, computes the distances between all pairs of points, and finds the minimum and maximum distances among them. The results are then printed to the console. Essentially, it performs geometric calculations on a set of points and provides distance-related statistics based on those calculations.
Calculates the distance between vectors.
